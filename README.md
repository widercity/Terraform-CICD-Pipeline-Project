1) Create a GitHub Repository with the name `Terraform-CICD-Pipeline-Project` and push the code in this branch(main) to 
    your remote repository (your newly created repository). 
    - Go to GitHub: https://github.com
    - Login to `Your GitHub Account`
    - Create a Repository called `Terraform-CICD-Pipeline-Project`
    - Clone the Repository in the `Repository` directory/folder on your `local machine`
    - Download the code in in this repository `"Main branch"`: https://github.com/awanmbandi/realworld-cicd-pipeline-project.git
    - `Unzip` the `code/zipped file`
    - `Copy` and `Paste` everything `from the zipped file` into the `repository you cloned` in your local
